# Colour-Tiles

### Plays the online game Color Tiles from:
* https://en.gamesaien.com/game/color_tiles/

### What does it do
* Takes a screenshot of the game board
* Randomly does moves and checks the score
* If the score was not high enough it tries again

### Why
* Some of my friends were playing and I though it would be fun to try and make a program to play the game more effectively and try to get a high score
